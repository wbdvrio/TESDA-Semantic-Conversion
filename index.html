        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <section>
          <p>
            The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) was
            established through the enactment of Republic Act No. 7796 otherwise
            known as the "Technical Education and Skills Development Act of
            1994", which was signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on
            August 25, 1994. This Act aims to encourage the full participation
            of and mobilize the industry, labor, local government units and
            technical-vocational institutions in the skills development of the
            country's human resources.
          </p>

          <p>
            The merging of the National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC) of the
            Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). The Bureau of Technical
            and Vocational Education (BTVE) of the Department of Education,
            Culture and Sports (DECS), and The Apprenticeship Program of the
            Bureau of Local Employment (BLE) of the DOLE gave birth to TESDA.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fusion of the above offices was one of the key recommendations
            of the 1991 Report of the Congressional Commission on Education,
            which undertook a national review of the state of Philippine
            education and manpower development. It was meant to reduce
            overlapping in skills development activities initiated by various
            public and private sector agencies, and to provide national
            directions for the country's technical-vocational education and
            training (TVET) system. Hence, a major thrust of TESDA is the
            formulation of a comprehensive development plan for middle-level
            manpower based on the National Technical Education and Skills
            Development Plan. This plan shall provide for a reformed
            industry-based training program that includes apprenticeship, dual
            training system and other similar schemes.
